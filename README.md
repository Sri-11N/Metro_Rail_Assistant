Overview

Metro rail passengers often face confusion related to ticketing, security checks, and boarding procedures—especially during peak hours. Station staff frequently handle repetitive questions, and printed signage alone is not always effective.
This project addresses the problem by introducing a Generative AI–based passenger guidance chatbot designed specifically for metro rail systems.

🎯 Problem Statement

Passengers misunderstand ticketing and boarding procedures

Security and platform rules are not always clear to first-time commuters

Station staff handle repetitive queries daily

Static signage is insufficient during peak travel hours

A safe AI-based explanation system is required without affecting metro operations

💡 Solution

We built a Metro Rail Passenger Guidance Bot using Gemini 3 Flash models that provides clear, simple, and fast explanations for common commuter questions.

The chatbot:

Explains metro ticket types

Describes security screening procedures

Guides passengers through entry and exit gates

Communicates platform rules and safety guidelines

Strict system prompts ensure the bot is informational only and does not:

Sell tickets

Provide real-time train schedules

Perform operational or control actions
